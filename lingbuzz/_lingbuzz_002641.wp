In this paper, I investigate the syntactic derivation of multiple sluicing in Indonesian and its implications for the idea of repair by ellipsis and the nature of the syntax-phonology interface within the framework of the Minimalist Program. I first present evidence based on the interaction of the Right Roof Constraint and P-stranding that the derivation of multiple sluicing in Indonesian involves overt leftward movement of more than one wh-phrase into the multiple specifiers of the interrogative C, unlike in the equivalent construction in English which has been shown in Lasnik (2014) to involve rightward focus movement of a non-initial wh-phrase into the vicinity of the same head. The hypothesized derivation seems puzzling, however, for Indonesian is a non-multiple wh-movement language, just like English. Drawing on Richards’ (1997, 2001)/Fox and Pesetsky’s (2003, 2005) idea that the derivation in question involves a linearization failure, I propose that the Indonesian multiple sluicing pattern is straightforwardly analysed by elliptical repair, which saves the derivation from crashing at PF. The proposed analysis raises several important theoretical questions regarding the different repair potentials of constraint violations, in particular, why the Right Roof Constraint cannot be repaired on a par with the otherwise illegal extraneous wh-movement. I suggest a plausible answer to this question from the vantage point of criterial/operator freezing (Bošković 2008; Rizzi 2006, 2010). To the extent that the proposed analysis is tenable, the results attained here provide powerful support for the basic minimalist architecture of the syntax-phonology interface, which involves both strictly computational/derivational violations and syntax-external/purely interface-oriented constraints.
