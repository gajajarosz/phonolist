A cross-linguistic examination of phonological behaviour generally supports the position that stops and fricatives form a single sonority class of obstruents. Among obstruents, however, /s/ stands out as exceptional: it often defies the phonotactic constraints that hold of other obstruents and commonly resists participating in processes that target or yield voiceless fricatives. Most of the literature on the unusual behaviour of /s/ has focused on word-initial sC clusters in Indo-European languages. However, sC clusters are sometimes considered to be an Indo-European anomaly, which leads us to question whether non-Indo-European languages have sC clusters displaying similar properties; and, more generally, whether /s/ behaves in unusual ways outside of Indo-European and how this should be formally expressed. These questions are addressed by examining /s/ in the syllabification systems of three unrelated languages: Acoma (Keres), Blackfoot (Algonquian) and Ōgami (Ryukyuan). In all three, /s/ functions unusually, but the patterns it displays differ from language to language and are, to a great extent, unlike what has been observed for Indo-European. As the behaviour that /s/ displays is not necessarily the same in all languages, this leads to the difficult challenge of finding a unified representation for /s/. Although it will be concluded that this is not possible, it will nevertheless be shown that the diverse phonotactic behaviour that /s/ displays can be analysed in terms of ordinary syllable constituents if an abstract view of the syllable is adopted.
