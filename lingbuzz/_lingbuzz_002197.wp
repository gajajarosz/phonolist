Noting that 'I-words' in Rasta Talk (e.g. Iquality "equality", Irits "spirits", Iration "creation", Irous "desirous", Yood "food", Yook "cook") bear certain similarities to lexical blends, I provide an Optimality Theoretical analysis of the process of Iformation (creating 'I-words').    In the speech of Rastafarians in Jamaica and elsewhere, Iformation is a salient process by which the first syllable of a word is replaced by /aɪ̯/ or /j/. Generally polysyllabic words adopt the former strategy and monosyllables the latter, but many exceptions to this generalisation exist---as well other unexpected forms like Iration "creation", Irous "desirous" are found.     Like lexical blending, Iformation typically involve outputs with same stress pattern and syllable count as primary source form. Additionally, both blends and Iformation takes both take advantage of fortuitous overlaps of phonological material, even where this affects the syllable count;  e.g. "croiSSANdwich"  (rather than *"croiwich"); cp. "Irous" 'desirous' (rather than *"Isirous").    Following on the substantial work on blending within the OT framework, this paper develops an OT analysis of the Rasta Talk process of Iformation.
