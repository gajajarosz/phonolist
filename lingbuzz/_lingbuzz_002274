ABSTRACT: In this paper, we compare the use of prosody in English and French to convey focus. While previous studies have found these languages to differ in their use of prosodic prominence to convey focus structure (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Cruttenden 1997, 2006; Ladd 2008), exactly what underlies the difference remains an open question. We investigate two possibilities: The differences might be due to phonological differences between English and French, that is, differences in the means to convey a prominence shift; or alternatively there might be semantic and pragmatic differences regarding what a prominence shifts conveys. We test these hypotheses in a production study in which we vary the type of focus context (corrective focus, contrastive focus, parallelism, cleft) to establish contextual distribution of prosodic prominence shifts; and at the same time we vary the phonological and syntactic size of the non-contrastive material, in order to test the hypothesis that the phonological conditions on prominence shifts differ. The results show that French and English use prominence very similarly to encode focus in certain contexts, such as corrective focus, irrespective of phonological factors. This similarity suggests that both languages have the phonological means to encode prominence shifts. They differ, however, with respect to the circumstances in which they use prosody, since French shows no evidence of prominence shift under parallelism, while English treats parallelism similar to corrective focus. Based on Rooth’s (1992) alternatives theory of focus, we propose that the semantic/pragmatic differences between English and French are a result of different scope possibilities of the focus operator involved in prosodic focus.
