ABSTRACT: We propose here a new PF-account of the that-trace effect. Adopting the recent phase-based theory of prosodic mapping and independent principles of prosodic restructuring, we propose that the complementizer that cannot form a prosodic phrase on its own for the purposes of prosodic phrasing. We show that this analysis straightforwardly derives the core paradigm surrounding the that-trace effect and its well-documented exceptions triggered by focus, adverbs, parentheticals, resumption, and right node raising.
