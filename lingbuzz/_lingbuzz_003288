ABSTRACT: In this paper I apply the conditions of Contiguity Theory (Richards 2016) to the problem of pied piping.  I derive the conditions on pied piping discovered by Cable (2007, 2010a, 2010b), and account for the connection discovered by Uribe-Etxebarria (2002) between the conditions on wh-in-situ in a given language and the conditions on pied-piping in that language.  In the end, as in Cable’s approach, pied-piping dissolves as a phenomenon; the same conditions that determine when overt movement must take place also determine how much material may be pied-piped.
