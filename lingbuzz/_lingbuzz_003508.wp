I give a formal model of phonology, which I call String Phonology, which maps strings  to strings. In line with substance-free and evolutionary phonology, the model doesn’t try to  limit phonology to ‘natural’ rules; instead, it’s supposed to be maximally general, performing  any sort of computation on strings given the pieces of machinery that are needed to account  for attested rules.    In section 2, I discuss some preliminaries in methodology around how to pick a theory of  phonology from the evidence. In section 3, I introduce the model; in section 4, I define the  operations that produce allowable strings; and in section 5, I explain the ‘delete-and-unify’  model of how rules act on strings. In section 6, I discuss what sorts of rules are possible and  impossible under this model.
