In this work we will analyze some recent proposals about how the result of the application of a generative algorithm is recognized as a unit for the purposes of further computations, and how each correlates, either explicitly or implicitly, with a model of the mind. We will propose, in line with previous works, that a mixed approach to mental computations (including both Markovian and non-linear dependencies) can prove useful at both theoretical and empirical levels when stated explicitly. We will argue that phrase markers include both kinds of dependencies between terminals and non-terminals: labeling requirements in a theory (which, in turn, interact with other conditions on phrase structure, binarity being the most notable) give away the conception a certain theory has about the (uniform or not) functioning of the mind.
