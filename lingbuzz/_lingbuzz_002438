ABSTRACT: The paper discusses the diachronic syntactic specialization of Romanian demonstratives according to the morphophonological weak/strong distinction, and the grammaticalization of the article CEL, specific to Romanian from a Romance perspective. It is shown that the reanalysis of the aphaeretic form of the distal demonstrative as the article CEL, through a grammaticalization process that regularly took place in the emergence of Romance determiners, strongly correlates with the diachronic specialization of Romanian demonstratives and with other syntactic changes taking place across-the-board in the Romanian DP.
