ABSTRACT: Labrune (2012) proposes a syllable-less theory of Japanese, by reviving the traditional view that Japanese has no syllables and instead has only moras below feet. Labrune (2012) argues that there is no phonetic or psycholinguistic evidence for the existence of syllables in Japanese. This reply summarizes previous experimental findings that demonstrate that Japanese does show evidence for syllables both phonetically and psycholinguistically. After the summary of previous studies, this reply also takes up a few phonological and theoretical issues that merit explicit response from the syllable proponent perspective, and concludes that Japanese does have syllables.
