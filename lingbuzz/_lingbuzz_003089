ABSTRACT: Developing ideas introduced in Bale et al. (2014), this paper explores some of the consequences of analyzing segments as sets of features and, as a corollary, analyzing natural classes as sets of sets. We adopt the view that features, not segments are the primitives of phonological representation: the “alphabetic symbols that we use freely [are] nothing more than convenient ad hoc abbreviations for feature bundles, introduced for ease of printing and reading but without systematic import” (Chomsky and Halle, 1968, 64). Taking these feature bundles to be sets allows us to apply ideas from set theory to phonology. In this paper, we explore some of the theoretical consequences of using set-theory to represent underspecification. In particular, we discuss the logical possibility that some segments may be fully underspecified and thus are represented by the empty-set. We also discuss how the empty-set can be used to define a natural class over all segments.
