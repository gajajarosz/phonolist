ABSTRACT: Since the establishment of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993), readjustment rules have been a central tenet of the theory. Readjustment is a post-Lexical-insertion phonological operation triggered on certain Vocabulary Item by some aspect of the morphosyntactic context (e.g. a vowel change on a noun Root like mouse, triggered either by the [PL] feature of Num0 or  the null affix exponent inserted to express the [PL] feature of Num0, to yield an output of mice). This process-based aspect of a syntacticocentric theory is quite odd, however, given DM’s otherwise “piece-based” (Item-and-Arrangement) orientation. Various DM practitioners seem to have adopted readjustment as a necessary evil, even while bringing to the fore its problematic aspects; see, e.g. Harley and Noyer’s (2000:133) observation about stem suppletion, that any theory that could allow radical stem readjustments (e.g. deriving worse from bad) “could presumably do anything”; and Embick and Halle’s (2005:60)  piece assumption (where, “all other things being equal, a piece-based analysis is preferred to a Readjustment Rule analysis when the morpho-syntactic decomposition justifies a piece-based treatment”). Some recent work in DM (see, e.g., Siddiqi 2006, 2009; Bermúdez-Otero 2012; Bye & Svenonius 2012; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013; Kilbourn-Ceron et al. this volume, etc.) has called into question the necessity of readjustment rules, and a variety of different approaches can perhaps indeed obviate them. The purpose of the present paper is to raise the metatheoretical question of whether or not readjustment (i.e. the alteration of stem phonology after lexical insertion) is needed for any morphological theory. The conceptual and empirical domains investigated here include: (i) the employment of readjustment rules as “secondary exponence” phenomena; (ii) verb stem allomorphy in the Uto-Aztecan languages Hiaki (Yaqui) and Classical Nahuatl; and (iii) verb stem allomorphy concurrent with reduplication in the Oceanic language Sye (Erromangan). The most cogent argument in favor of readjustment rules over stem-listing approaches invokes the frequent phonological regularity of stem alternants (e.g., Harley and Tubino Blanco’s 2013 analysis of stem form alternations Hiaki). I adopt an alternative analysis whereby such regularities can be just as felicitously explained by appealing to historical linguistic processes rather than to readjustment rules applying in the synchronic grammar. This discussion thus falls under the purview of what Kiparsky (2006) has described as an “amphichronic program for linguistic theory”.
