It is well established that languages make use of phonetic duration to signal (binary) lexical contrasts.  Languages can also use phonetic duration to signal a different kind of meaning: emphasis (e.g., English "She's sooooo cool").  While lexical short/long contrasts are well represented in the literature, emphatic lengthening has received less attention.  A primary difference between these two uses of phonetic duration is that lexical contrasts tend to be binary distinctions, whereas emphatic lengthening can make use of more fine-grained distinctions.<br><br>    Recent studies have shown that at least some Japanese speakers can make six-way duration contrasts when they emphatically lengthen vowels (Kawahara & Braver 2013) and consonants (Kawahara & Braver 2014).  One question that remains is whether native language plays a role in speakers' ability to produce such fine-grained distinctions: are Japanese speakers in a better position to make such distinctions because their native language has a binary length contrast?<br><br>    In this paper, we present an experiment which shows that some speakers of English (a language without a lexical length contrast) are able to produce fine-grained durational distinctions, just like Japanese speakers<br><br>    These results support two claims.  First, we argue that speaking a language with a native binary lexical length distinction is not necessary for the production of fine-grained durational differences.  Further, we argue that the cross-linguistic preference for binary (as opposed to, e.g. ternary or quaternary) duration contrasts is not due solely to restrictions on production.
