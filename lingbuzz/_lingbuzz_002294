ABSTRACT: This squib shows that the constraint *Lapse cannot generate ternary stress and creates pathologies in Harmonic Serialism (HS). The constraint *Lapse works properly only when it can evaluate an entirely metrified string, which is impossible in HS. Only *FootFoot, which refers to metrical constituents rather than the distribution of peaks and troughs, can derive ternarity. This supports an analysis based on non-adjacency of constituent edges; in HS, feet are therefore required.
