ABSTRACT: Brazilian Portuguese pronominal and non-pronominal clitics are generally assumed to undergo the same phonological phenomena. Both show vowel raising and vowel sandhi with the initial vowel of the host and thus differ from unstressed monosyllabic prefixes, which are not expected to undergo such processes (Bisol, 2000, 2005). However, an analysis of vowel raising in pronominal clitic se (3SG/PL.REFL/INDET/PASS) and non-pronominal clitic se (‘if’) shows that the phenomenon is significantly more frequent in non-pronominal se. This fact, as well as morphosyntactic distinctions between these two categories of clitics, indicates that pronominal and non-pronominal clitics are mapped onto the prosodic hierarchy in two separate domains. While non-pronominal clitics are prosodized in the phonological phrase (PPh), pronominal clitics are prosodized in the composite group (CG; Vogel (2009)), the domain between the phonological word (PWd) and the PPh onto which structures with compositional characteristics are prosodically mapped.
