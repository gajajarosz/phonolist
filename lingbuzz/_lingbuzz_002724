ABSTRACT: This paper argues that phonological conditions can be satisfied not only by word-internal morphological and phonological repairs but also by repairs in the syntactic domain across word boundaries. Evidence is drawn from a range of phonologically-conditioned syntactic phenomena. A survey of such phenomena demonstrates that instances of phonologically-conditioned syntactic behavior have crucial analogies to more familiar and common phenomena of phonologically-conditioned morphology. In addition, two case studies from corpus analyses of spoken American English are presented to further demonstrate that syntactic repairs--specifically, alternations of word order or construction choice--can be used in satisfying phonological constraints. Together, the survey and case study results presented here show that the apparent differences that arise between phonologically-conditioned morphological and syntactic alternations can be attributed to locality and domain effects, of boundary size and of prosodic/segmental levels. This suggests that phonologically-conditioned syntactic behavior may simply be a more extreme relative of phonologically-conditioned morphology, under a view of comparative grammaticality.
