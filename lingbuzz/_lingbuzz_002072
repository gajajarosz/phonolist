ABSTRACT: One (often implicit) motivation for a theory of knowledge representation (KR) comes from an argument from acquisition, with the idea that language acquisition is straightforward if children's hypothesis space is defined by the correct KR. Acquisition is then the process of selecting the correct grammar from that hypothesis space, based on language input. To compare KR theories, we establish quantitative acquisition-based metrics that assess learnability from realistic input data. We conduct a   learnability analysis for three KR theories proposed for metrical phonology and evaluate them on  English, a language that is notoriously irregular with respect to metrical phonology and therefore non-trivial to learn. We find that all three KRs have similar learnability potential, but the proposed English grammars within each theory are not the grammars able to account for the most English child input data, even if the learner has some knowledge of the interaction between English metrical phonology and morphology. This suggests learnability issues exist for the proposed English grammar in all three theories if a learner is attempting to learn a grammar that accounts for as much input data as possible. We discuss ways a learner may still be able to learn the English grammar from English input by incorporating (i) additional useful linguistic knowledge about English metrical phonology interactions and (ii) biases to selectively learn from the input. We additionally discuss which aspects of the proposed English grammars are hurting learnability, observing that small changes in parameter values or constraint-rankings lead to significantly better learnability results.
