ABSTRACT: In this article two main topics are addressed: the treatment of vowel-sonorant interaction processes and, as a crucial point, the nature of phonological representations. As to the first point, data from some Italo-Romance and Romansh varieties will be examined. In particular the relation between segmental phonological content and its prosodic manifestation will be explored combining the experimental observations with the documented phenomena. The second point has been recently explored and in particular the most debated points concern the explanatory role of structure and its relation with the melodic content of segments (Kaye 2014, Pöchtrager and Kaye 2013, Pöchtrager 2006, 2015, van Oostemdorp 2013).
