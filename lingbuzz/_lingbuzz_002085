ABSTRACT: The interaction of prosody — including both segmental and tone melody — with syntax and semantics in Niger-Congo languages has been extensively treated in phonological terms (Downing, 2006; J. L. Smith, 2011). This paper shows that approaching prosodification through the lens of syntax yields both empirical and theoretical benefits. Empirically, attending to the syntax of prosodification provides insight into the structure of the lexicon across the Niger-Congo language family. Most notably, it permits a formal account of the relation between regular and ideophonic vocabulary items. Theoretically, it forces a re-conceptualization of the prosody-syntax and prosody-semantics interface, as well as the syntax-semantics interface. In particular, it challenges one of the tenets of Distributed Morphology, namely that the entire lexicon is category-less (Embick & Marantz, 2008). More broadly, it also challenges the Saussurean dictate that the relation between form and meaning is always arbitrary. Finally, it confirms the architecture proposed in the model of Interface Syntax (Wiltschko & Déchaine, 2010), which correctly predicts that prosody can associate directly with syntactic or semantic atoms, namely both phono-syntactic (sound-category) and phono-semantic (sound-meaning) bundling is attested.
