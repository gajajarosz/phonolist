The Science of Language (SoL) disputes the relevance of natural selection, the absence of a directing force in evolution, the presence and role of genetic variation, and the scientific method. In essence, SoL’s subtext is that Noam Chomsky has refuted the Darwinian theory of evolution and forged a new model for scientific enquiry. In place of the methods of modern science, SoL praises the ‘rationalist’ views of Platonists and seventeenth-century philosophers, which may explain why Chomsky, disputing Darwin, firmly holds to the view that there must be directing principles behind evolution. ough God is never mentioned in the volume, some form of magic must have spread Merge throughout humankind if, as Chomsky asserted in 1972, natural selection has ‘no substance’.
