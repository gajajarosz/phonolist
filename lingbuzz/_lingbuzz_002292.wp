In this paper, we explore the grammar of two types of speech act modifiers: particles and sentence intonation. In particular, we explore the modification of declarative clauses. A formally declarative clause (SVO order) is typically used as an assertion. It may, however, be modified by either sentence intonation or a sentence-peripheral particle, and the result is an utterance which is associated with a different type of speech act, namely a biased question or a request for confirmation, respectively. We further explore the cross-linguistic variation that such speech act modifiers display. In particular, we investigate the difference between tonal and non-tonal languages. We show that in tonal languages, particles take over the function of sentence intonation. And finally, on the basis of our findings, we conclude that the construction of speech acts is mediated syntactically. As such, we contribute to the growing literature which can be characterized as a revival of Ross’ (1970) performative hypothesis.
