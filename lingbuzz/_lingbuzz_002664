ABSTRACT: Native speakers perceive illusory vowels when presented with consonant sequences that violate phonotactic constraints in their language. Previous research suggests that the phenomenon motivates speech perception models that include surface phonotactic information and are sensitive to the acoustics of the speech tokens. In this article, inspired by Bayesian models of speech perception, we claim that the task of the listener in speech perception is to identify the target underlying representations. This predicts that the phenomenon of perceptual illusions will be modulated, not only by surface phonotactics and the acoustics of the speech tokens, but also by the phonological alternations of a language. We present the results of three experiments (an AX task, an ABX task, and an identification task) on native Korean listeners, with native English listeners as controls, showing that they perceive different sets of illusory vowels in different phonological contexts, in accordance with the phonological processes of Vowel Deletion and Palatalization in the language.
