ABSTRACT: I am uploading the introduction and second chapter of a new book in progress, Dark Matter of the Mind. I place these here for comments. The second chapter provides a novel theory of human culture and the introduction overviews the book as a whole. Comments may be sent to the email on the cover page. The book also looks in depth at aspects of human communication and translation, the philosophical history of the study of tacit knowledge, and so on - as summarized in the intro. It argues that we need to move beyond ideas of instincts and innate behaviors, as well as the notions of "the psychic unity of mankind", human nature, and similar notions.
