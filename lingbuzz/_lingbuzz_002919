ABSTRACT: In Czech as well as other Slavic languages, verbal particles (throw the cat OUT) are always glued to the verb, and can never be separated from it. Therefore, they are traditionaly analyzed as forming a complex head with the verb. Against this background, we look at an alternation in vocalic length that can be found with a couple of prefixes in Czech. We argue that the best way to understand this alternation is in terms of their free/bound status. Hence, we propose that despite the fact that the prefixes are always glued to the verb, they actually undergo the same process as Germanic particles. The reason why they are always glued to the verb is because of the way pied-piping works; when the verb moves, it moves as a big phrase and always carries the particle along.
