ABSTRACT: Imagine a theory of phonology that makes no reference to well-formedness, repair, contrast, typology, variation, language change, markedness, `child phonology', faithfulness, constraints, phonotactics, articulatory or acoustic phonetics, or speech perception.   What remains in such a phonological theory  constitutes the components of the Substance Free Phonology (SFP) model I will sketch here. My task  thus involves  not only justifying the exclusion of all those  domains, but also  arguing that something remains that is worthy of the name `phonology'. In support of the latter task, I'll   provide some positive examples of recent research in SFP.
