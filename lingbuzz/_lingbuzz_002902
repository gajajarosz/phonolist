ABSTRACT: In this study we have analyzed the difference in boundary tone in northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) in four different sentence structures: Declarative, Imperative, Exclamatory and Interrogative. The study shows that the mean difference in all sentence structures in Kurmanji language is 59 and the L%, L+H%, H%, L%, and % changes in the ToBI system were observed. In this paper we propose a systematic way to transcribe Kurdish intonation named: KuBI (Kurdish ToBI)
