ABSTRACT: This paper investigates how weight affects stress in Portuguese. Two domains of weight are compared side by side, namely, syllables and intervals (Steriade 2012). The patterns found in the Portuguese Stress Corpus (Garcia 2014) argue for an interval-based account, as onset effects are inconsistent with (traditional) syllable theory. A statistical model based on intervals is more accurate, more empirically motivated and more parsimonious than a syllable-based model. Finally, weight is shown to be gradient within and across all three positions in the stress domain, contra previous analyses of stress in Portuguese.
