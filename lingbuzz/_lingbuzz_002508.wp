We argue that the linear position of certain pronominal elements in Irish is determined, at least in part, by purely prosodic considerations. Pronoun placement is clearly structurally-conditioned, but also largely indifferent to normal constraints on syntactic movement. Furthermore, the positioning of pronouns depends on constituent parses that seem quite bizarre from the perspective of syntax. By assuming that the operative notion of structure in this case is prosodic, rather than syntactic, we provide a better account of the patterning of pronouns in Irish. This approach, which is developed within an independently-motivated picture of prosody in Irish and elsewhere, also permits a natural explanation of the prosodic consequences of pronoun positioning.
