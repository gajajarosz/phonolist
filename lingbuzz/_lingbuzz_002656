ABSTRACT: The phonotactics of a language concerns the well-formedness of strings of sounds as potential words (e.g., paim is a better potential word of English than mlpemr). Speakers’ phonotactic judgments are informed not only by the distribution of particular sounds ([b] or [g]) but also by the distribution of classes of sounds (e.g., voiced stops). In a series of artificial language experiments, we investigate how such generalizations over classes of sounds are acquired, focusing on the evaluating the proposal that generalizations must be acquired in a specific-to-general sequence – i.e., that learners must first learn the statistics of multiple individual sounds that belong to a class before they can generalize to the class. Contrary to this proposal, learners acquired knowledge over classes earlier than sound-specific knowledge, and showed an ability to generalize to a class based on a single example of the class. We discuss the implications of our findings for computational models of phonotactic learning.
