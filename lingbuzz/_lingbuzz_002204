ABSTRACT: Labrune (2014) argues that Japanese /r/ is structurally empty. This reply argues that the phonological characteristics of /r/ which are discussed by Labrune (2014) come with many systematic exceptions, and hence they are better handled in terms of violable constraints. Alternative analyses based on Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004) are presented. This reply also points out that the three constraints on /r/ that are discussed by Labrune (2014) are in fact not specific to /r/, and therefore, motivating structural emptiness based on these patterns would face a problem of not being able to distinguish these segments. Based on these considerations, this reply concludes that /r/ (and other segments) should have segmental contents.
