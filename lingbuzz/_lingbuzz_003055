ABSTRACT: Many languages disprefer sequences of nasal-stop clusters (*[NC(1) V NC(2)]). In languages where this restriction is active, there are several attested repairs. For example, in many languages, /NC(1)/ is realized as a plain nasal consonant (/NC(1) V NC(2)/ > [N(1) V NC(2)]); in others, /NC(2)/ is realized as a plain oral consonant (/NC(1) V NC(2)/ > [NC(1) V C(2)]). This paper addresses the following question: what is the nature of the markedness constraint that drives these alternations? Following Jones (2000) (see also Herbert 1986), I argue that these alternations are motivated by a constraint on contrast: [NC(1) V NC(2)] is perceptually dispreferred. I show that the the contrast-based analysis correctly predicts a number of typological generalizations, many of which cannot be derived by an alternative, OCP-based analysis.
