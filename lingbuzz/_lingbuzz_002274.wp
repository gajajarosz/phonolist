In this paper, we compare the use of prosody in English and French to convey focus.  While previous studies have found these languages to differ in their use of prosodic prominence  to convey focus structure (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Cruttenden 1997, 2006; Ladd 2008), exactly  what underlies the difference remains an open question. We investigate two possibilities: The  differences might be due to phonological differences between English and French, that is,  differences in the means to convey a prominence shift; or alternatively there might be semantic  and pragmatic differences regarding what a prominence shifts conveys. We test these hypotheses  in a production study in which we vary the type of focus context (corrective focus, contrastive  focus, parallelism, cleft) to establish contextual distribution of prosodic prominence shifts; and at  the same time we vary the phonological and syntactic size of the non-contrastive material, in  order to test the hypothesis that the phonological conditions on prominence shifts differ. The  results show that French and English use prominence very similarly to encode focus in certain  contexts, such as corrective focus, irrespective of phonological factors. This similarity suggests  that both languages have the phonological means to encode prominence shifts. They differ,  however, with respect to the circumstances in which they use prosody, since French shows no  evidence of prominence shift under parallelism, while English treats parallelism similar to  corrective focus. Based on Roothâ€™s (1992) alternatives theory of focus, we propose that the  semantic/pragmatic differences between English and French are a result of different scope  possibilities of the focus operator involved in prosodic focus.
