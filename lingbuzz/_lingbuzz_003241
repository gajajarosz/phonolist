ABSTRACT: I have proposed analyses of English 'went' and of English '*goed' that revolve around the notion of verbal theme vowel. These analyses do not invoke late  insertion. It may be that late insertion is systematically unavailable. That may be due to the fact that merge-based bottom-to-top derivations start with the phonology, merging phonological features and then segments, before moving up to syntactic features; if so, phonology feeds syntax and should not be factored out of it.
