ABSTRACT: This paper investigates how the location of primary stress in Portuguese is influenced by weight. Traditionally, the effect of weight in Portuguese is seen as categorical, and only word-final syllables are considered to be weight-sensitive—i.e., the weight of penult and antepenult syllables is not relevant for stress. I examine stress placement across a comprehensive lexicon of Portuguese non-verbs (Houaiss et al. 2001), and show that weight effects (i) are also present word-internally and (ii) gradually weaken as we move away from the right edge of the word—this gradience is supported by different Ordinal Regression models. I compare two theories of weight domain, namely, the syllable and the interval (Steriade 2012)— defined as a rhythmic unit that spans from one vowel up to (but not including) the next vowel. Under both theories, weight has a gradient effect on stress, and is not limited to the right edge of the word. The data analysed suggest that intervals may be more accurate representations of the weight domain in Portuguese, in that they appropriately capture onset effects found in the lexicon that are not accounted for under syllable theory. In addition, interval-based models are more accurate than syllable-based models. Finally, I briefly demonstrate how the analysis proposed here can be mapped into a MaxEnt model (Goldwater & Johnson 2003, Wilson 2006, Hayes & Wilson 2008).
