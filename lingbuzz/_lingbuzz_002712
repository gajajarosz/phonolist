ABSTRACT: This short review offers a summary of the CVX theory proposed in Duanmu (2009). CVX theory is an attempt to reduce the varied shape of syllables in languages of the world to an invariant template in CVX (Consonant + vowel + consonant/vowel). Potential counterexamples are dealt with by attributing extra segments at edges to morphological effects and proposing different analyses of the segments in question. I tentatively suggest problems with this approach, and offer a hard counterexample (VVN syllable) from Fuzhou, which Duanmu (2009: 85) explicitly predicts not to exist.
