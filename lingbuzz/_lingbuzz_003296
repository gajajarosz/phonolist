ABSTRACT: Hawu (Malayo-Polynesian) shows highly unusual distributions of phonological strength and weakness (Walker 1982, Grimes 2006, Blust 2008). Firstly, Hawu appears unique in restricting schwa to stressed positions and excluding it from all prosodically weak positions. Secondly, the language has rampant intervocalic lenition of consonants, however, it is only after a schwa that consonants are immune to lenition. These conditions have resulted in unusual V-to-Stress and V-C phonotactics, as well as setting up some interesting structural contrasts: (a) <w ~ b:> [qáwu] ‘secret’ vs. [ɗə́b:u] ‘sugarcane’. (b) <ʔ  ~ k:> [níʔi] ‘fruit bat’ vs. [lə́k:u] ‘fold’. (c) <r ~ d:/ɗ:> [tára] ‘cockspur’ vs. [kə́ɗ:u] ‘stand up’. (d) <d ~ t:> [máda] ‘eye’ vs. [wə́t:a] ‘split’. (e) <∅ ~ p:> [ní] ‘dream’ vs. [ə́p:at] ‘four’.  This paper shows that these distributions can be insightfully handled in the Strict CV framework. On the surface, Hawu is near unique. It may even appear to violate a linguistic universal, however this is all due to its unusual phonetic mapping. In fact, analysed phonologically, its distribution of strength and weakness is revealed to be commonplace, highly reminiscent of Tuscan Italian. This account relies on three analytic steps. Firstly, schwa, a phonologically featureless vowel, consists of three allophones: [e] in pre-tonic position, [ə] in stressed position, and [a] in post-tonic position. It actually has no phonological positional restrictions. Secondly, Hawu is reanalysed as a quantity-sensitive language with ‘metrical bolstering’. Schwa is a weak vowel and cannot satisfy the quantity requirement of a stressed position. For this reason, it triggers automatic gemination of a neighbouring consonant. Thirdly, in stressed position, full (non-schwa) vowels are phonologically heavy but this phonological weight is manifested phonetically as a non-reduced vowel quality, rather than increased duration. This phonology-to-phonetics mapping, known as ‘virtual length’ (Scheer 2014), is robustly attested in Semitic (Lowenstamm 1991, 2011) and Berber (Ben Si Saïd 2011) though this is its first attestation in Austronesian. In traditional terms one can say that, despite appearances, Hawu is a quantity-sensitive language. There is a metrical requirement for each Hawu word contain a heavy syllable. Weight in Hawu comes from either: (a) non-schwa vowel, or (b) a schwa + geminate consonant. The phonological weight of full vowels is not mapped to a phonetic length contrast. Instead, the phonetic interpretation of phonological quantity is expressed by a vowel’s unreduced quality.  This analysis brings with it three explanatory advantages over previous models. Firstly, it provides an explanation for the lack of (C)ə́V word-shapes. Secondly, it explains the strange condition on Hawu metathesis, that it must apply across a consonant: *VαCVβ > VβCVα - *ika > [ə́k:i] ‘tie/bind’ vs. *VαVβ **(> VβVα) *bua > [búe] **[bə́u] ‘fruit’. In this Strict CV account, both facts fall out of the fact that their outputs would violate the quantity restrictions imposed by the language’s metrical system. Also it further supports Lysvik (2015) in diagnosing Hawu as a case of pseudo-metathesis. Moreover, there is an important implication for phonological theory; because, under the standard analysis, Hawu’s uniqueness implies that this phonological system had developed only once in human history. In fact, its uniqueness is merely the product of language specific phonetic mappings (surface effects) and the phonological system is commonplace.
