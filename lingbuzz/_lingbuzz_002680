ABSTRACT: There is an extensive literature on the syllabic affiliations of specific consonants that are typically referred to as ambisyllabic consonants. The standard view of such consonants is that they are multiply-linked to both the preceding and the following syllables (Gussenhoven, 1986; Hayes, 2009; Kahn, 1976, inter alia). In this article, we present the results of a production experiment probing the nasalization patterns of nasal consonants with different syllabic affiliations in American English; we also present phonological data about devoicing patterns from Pennsylvania Dutchified English (PDE). Both lines of evidence suggest that when crucial confounds present in previous studies are removed, word-medial ambisyllabic consonants clearly pattern with word-medial codas and not with word-medial onsets. Furthermore, this is true of such consonants following both tense and lax vowels in our results.
