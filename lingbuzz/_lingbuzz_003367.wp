The observed pronunciations or spellings  of words are often explained as arising  from the “underlying forms” of their morphemes.  These forms are latent strings that  linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We  propose to reconstruct them automatically  at scale, enabling generalization to new  words. Given some surface word types  of a concatenative language along with the  abstract morpheme sequences that they express,  we show how to recover consistent  underlying forms for these morphemes,  together with the (stochastic) phonology  that maps each concatenation of underlying  forms to a surface form. Our technique  involves loopy belief propagation in a natural  directed graphical model whose variables  are unknown strings and whose conditional  distributions are encoded as finitestate  machines with trainable weights. We  define training and evaluation paradigms  for the task of surface word prediction, and  report results on subsets of 7 languages
