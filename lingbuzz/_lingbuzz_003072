ABSTRACT: Human language is not entirely arbitrary. Recent advances in the literature have shown sound symbolism to facilitate word-learning and acquisition cross-linguistically. Most research focuses on the segment level and not much is known about the prosody or the role it plays in the sound symbolism of tonal and non-tonal languages alike. By comparing sound-symbolic corpora with general lexicon corpora, this study shows that the sound-symbolic lexicons of three Sinitic varieties (Mandarin, Taiwanese Southern Min, Hong Kong Cantonese) are skewed so that the majority of sound-symbolic syllables are in high tone while the general lexicon is not. Building on the idea that gesture and eye movement facilitate word-learning, it is proposed that prosodic demarcation of descriptive and non-arbitrary words is analogous to a gesture in the speech stream which helps the listener (child) pinpoint its referent. This systematic mapping may be derived from the lexical embodiment of expressive voice like that found in Infant Directed Speech.
