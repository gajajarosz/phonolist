ABSTRACT: This paper explores the shapes of interlanguage grammars in the syllable structure domain from the perspective of the evidence available to learners indicating the well- or ill-formedness of /s/+consonant clusters in the language being learnt and how this interfaces with cross-linguistically motivated constraints on representation. The paper begins with the sonority profile of word-initial /s/+consonant clusters, and concludes that the constraints they respect mirror those that hold of coda+onset clusters, rather than branching onsets. This, in turn, is used to motivate different representations for each: /s/+consonant clusters are heterosyllabic, where /s/ is the coda of an empty-headed syllable, while obstruent-initial clusters form branching onsets. Drawing on data from several studies in the literature, the paper then turns to examine the acquisition of word-initial /s/+consonant clusters when the native language grammar is a subset of the second language as concerns cluster profile: East Asian and Ibero-Romance learners of Germanic. It is argued that cross-language differences in the developmental patterns observed ¬– that is, whether or not they respect /s/+consonant cluster well-formedness on the sonority dimension – stem from the presence or absence of true branching onsets in the native language grammar, including the (un)suitability of redeploying this structure for /s/+consonant clusters, which is proposed to be linked to the relative stridency of /s/ in the native language. The paper then turns to examine the acquisition of /s/+consonant cluster ill-formedness when the first language grammar is a superset of the second language for word-initial cluster profile: English-speaking naïve learners of Brazilian Portuguese. It is experimentally shown that second language learners can use indirect positive evidence to learn that /s/+consonant clusters are ill-formed in the language being learnt: evidence from errors in the learner’s first language made by native speakers of the learner’s second language.
