ABSTRACT: Halle’s (1959) argument against a distinction between morphophonemic and  phonemic rules can be understood as an argument against the relevance of contrast  to phonology. After adducing further arguments against a role for contrast,  the paper provides a simple contrast-free analysis of the classic problem of the  voicing behavior of Russian /v/. This segment undergoes voicing assimilation  (like other obstruents), but does not trigger it (thus acting like the sonorants). In  contrast to a long history of treating /v/ as a covert sonorant, the paper attributes  the behavior of Russian /v/, which surfaces always as an obstruent, to underspecification  with respect to the feature Voice.
