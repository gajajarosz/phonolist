ABSTRACT: What would be the implications of applying categorial grammar technology to phonological structure? We show how expressing phonological insights requires a few extensions into the formalism in order to be able to deal with autosegmentalism, with feature repulsion and with the interface with syntax (and possibly with semantics). It is argued that both our understanding of categorial grammar and phonology can profit from the confrontation.
