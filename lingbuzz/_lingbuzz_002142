ABSTRACT: This paper addresses the general issue of the quality of phonological data, using rendaku as a case study. Rendaku is a well-known voicing process that accompanies compound formation in Japanese. The issue of the quality of phonological data has been discussed from time to time from various perspectives throughout the history of phonological research, with recent renewed interests. This paper takes up rendaku as a case study to discuss this issue, because, rendaku has been used to argue for many theoretical apparatuses, and has appeared in many textbooks, but it is rarely acknowledged in the theoretical literature that rendaku involves extensive lexical irregularity. The specific question addressed in this study is whether it is appropriate to use rendaku for phonological argumentation. Ultimately, the answer that this paper will propose is yes, but the more crucial lesson is that the theoretical phonology should examine the quality of phonological data more explicitly.
