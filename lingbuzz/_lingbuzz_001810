ABSTRACT: This paper discusses reduplication as a technique of word formation in German within the framework of Optimality Theory. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed taxonomy identifies rhyme and ablaut reduplication as the only productive, truly reduplicative processes in the morphology of German. All other contemplable cases of reduplicative structures are properly treated as either phonological doubling, lexical sequencing or (special cases of) compounding. An OT analysis is offered which suggests that both rhyme and ablaut reduplication may emerge when a segmentally and prosodically unspecified expressive morpheme is attached to a base - given that the base strictly obeys certain word prosodic requirements. The present approach eschews constraints that make explicit reference to base-reduplicant correspondence. The OT grammar successfully models the emergence of the fixed bipedal structure, the obligatory segmental deviance of the reduplicant, non-exponence of the expressive morpheme in the case of non-trochaic bases, the variable linearization of base and reduplicant in ablaut reduplication, and the interaction of reduplication with i) segmental alternations and ii) onset complexity. Certain (cross-linguistic) correlations regarding constraints on reduplicative word formation and poetic devices, such as rhyme and meter, are discussed.
