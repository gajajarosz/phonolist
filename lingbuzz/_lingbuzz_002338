ABSTRACT: In this paper, I discuss Scandinavian verb particle constructions from the perspective of the intonational properties of the Scandinavian languages. I show with experimental data that the final pitch peak occurs on the main verb in East Swedish and Övdalian, in which object pronouns cannot move across a particle, whereas it occurs on the sentence-final particle in East Norwegian and East Danish, in which object pronouns move across a particle. The grammatical word order of verb particle constructions conforms to the basic pitch pattern of the main verb in each respective language, i.e. a HL contour in East Swedish, a LHLH(L) contour in Övdalian, a HLH contour in East Norwegian and a LH contour in East Danish. Those basic pitch patterns correlate with the absence of Object Shift in East Swedish and Övdalian on one hand, and its presence in East Norwegian and East Danish on the other.
