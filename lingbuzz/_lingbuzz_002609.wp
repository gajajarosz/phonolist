In Buriat, the consonant realized contextually as dorsal or uvular alternates with zero at stem-suffix boundaries (Poppe, 1938, 1960; Sanžeev, 1941; Sanžeev et al., 1962; Čeremisov, 1973). This alternation has been known as a case epenthesis that challenges the existing theories of phonological markedness (Rice, 2008; Morley, 2015; Vaux & Samuels, 2015). The analysis of this alternation has also been debated (de Lacy, 2006; de Lacy & Kingston, 2013). This paper presents new fieldwork and experimental evidence showing that the reported epenthesis pattern fails to be generalized to new environments. The results go against the phonological insertion account of the alternation, and instead support the analysis of Buriat dorsal-zero alternation in terms of floating features, present only on the relevant native affixes. These results thus suggest that Buriat is not a counterexample to dorsal markedness. The fact that dorsal epenthesis is not generalized despite relatively robust native evidence is also consistent with a learning bias against unnatural alternations (White, 2014; Hayes & White, 2015).
