ABSTRACT: To open up the workshop, I will begin this talk by laying out issues concerning the phonetics of geminates. Drawing on the phonetic data from different languages, I discuss similarities and differences of the phonetics of geminates across different languages. The issues addressed in this part of the talk include: (1) duration ratios between geminates and singletons (2) the effects of geminates on the duration of preceding vowels (3) the differences (or lack thereof) in terms of VOT and burst (4) spectral correlates of geminates (5) how these properties do—and do not—affect the perception of geminates. Then, I briefly touch on several topics that need to be addressed concerning the phonetics of geminates. These include (1) the issue of invariance across different speaking styles (2) the effect of manner of articulation on the phonetic realizations of geminates (3) the phonetics of voiced obstruent geminates (4) the phonetics of derived geminates vs. underlying geminates (5) the phonetics of non-intervocalic geminates.
